# Building-a-city-skyline-using-CSS-variables
In this project, I have built a city skyline using HTML and CSS. It mainly uses flex-box, linear-gradient, repeating-linear-gradient, radial gradient, media query and CSS variables to develop this colorful picture.
This project has responsive web design which adjusts on devices of varying screen-size. It becomes day-scenary in full-screen and night-scenary on reducing screen size.
